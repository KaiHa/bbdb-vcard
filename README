bbdb-vcard.el
=============

bbdb-vcard.el imports VCARDs (version 3.0) as defined in RFC2425 and
RFC2426 into The Insidious Big Brother Database (BBDB). There are
already a few similar libraries to which this one is unrelated.

On a file, a buffer or a region containing one or more vcards, use
`bbdb-vcard-import-file', `bbdb-vcard-import-buffer', or
`bbdb-vcard-import-region' respectively to import them into BBDB.

Refer to the Commentary in file bbdb-vcard.el for further information.
